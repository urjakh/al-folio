We participated in the [2023 Dialogue System Technology Challenge](https://dstc11.dstc.community/), co-located at INLG 2023. We used few-shot data augmentation and waterfall prompting for response generation for task-oriented conversational modelling using subjective knowledge. Our paper can be found [here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.dstc-1.22/).

I have joined the Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and will be receiving joint supervision from Antske Fokkens, Eric Nalisnick, and Ivar Vermeulen.
My project will focus on the generalizability of NLP experiments and hate speech detection as a use-case.

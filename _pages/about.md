I am a PhD Student at the 
[Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL)](http://www.cltl.nl/){:target="\_blank"} 
at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl). 
My project is a part of the [Hybrid Intelligence Centre](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/) 
under the Explainability pillar and is on the generalizability of NLP experiments.
I work on understanding what kind of information a language model has captured
to gain insights on how such a model will behave on unseen or out-of-distribution data. 
My research interests lie on the intersection of NLP and machine learning; 
error analysis, generalization, interpretability, and explainability. 
As a use case for my project, I am also working on hate speech detection and am committed to do research ethically.  
I am being supervised by [Antske Fokkens](http://wordpress.let.vupr.nl/antske/) (VU), 
[Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/) (UvA), and [Ivar Vermeulen](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/ivar-vermeulen) (VU).

Before my PhD, I completed my BSc and MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/)
where I found my passion for Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision and
 applying these techniques to improve society positively. 
I channeled this by being a mentor and TA for second year bachelor AI 
students and working on several projects where I was able to apply the 
knowledge I obtained. My bachelor thesis was on the detection of fake news
headlines and statements and my master thesis was on explainable and generalized 
deepfake detection. More details can be found on my CV.

I spent my summer visiting the [DILL Lab](https://dill-lab.github.io/), working with [dr. Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) on incorporating human subjectivity for improved calibrated hate speech detection models. Project is still on-going. It was a sunny summer in Los Angeles, University of Southern California!

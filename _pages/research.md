description: An overview of my research interests.

#### research interests.
Making a _positive_ impact is what drives me. Hence, the following research topics and questions 
are (amongst others) what my current interests are and what I want to work on in the future: 

**Understanding generalization capabilities.** This includes rigorous analyses of model capabilities 
and extensive **model evaluation**;
designing tools and metrics that go beyond aggregate metrics to give us more insight into model 
strengths and weaknesses. _What is in the data? What did the model learn from it? What does this 
mean for real-world data?_
  
**AI for social good.** Language models are increasingly affecting our daily lives and especially 
certain applications require us to develop models with a lot of care. This goes beyond the 
conventional performance-driven model development. _How can we address such safety-critical applications?_ 

**Multicultural Human-Centred systems design.** As end-users of most language models, it is of 
utmost importance that the systems are designed with keeping humans in mind. Every user comes 
with their own experience, values, and beliefs. _How can we design adaptive systems that accommodate 
this diversity and subjectivity? How can we ensure that our systems are useful for a wide set of users?_

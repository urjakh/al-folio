I will be joining the Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 
I will be receiving joint supervision from Antske Fokkens, Eric Nalisnick, and Ivar Vermeulen.
My project will focus on the generalizability of NLP experiments and hate speech detection as a use-case.

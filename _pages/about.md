I am a PhD Student at the [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL)](http://www.cltl.nl/)
at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl), working on the generalizability of NLP experiments.
I am interested in understanding what kind of information a language model has captured
to gain insights on how such a model will behave on unseen or out-of-distribution data. 
My research interests lie on the intersection of NLP and machine learning; 
error analysis, generalization, interpretability, and explainability. 
As a use case for my project, I am also working on hate speech detection and am committed to do research ethically.  
I am advised by [Antske Fokkens](http://wordpress.let.vupr.nl/antske/) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) and 
[Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/) (Johns Hopkins University).

Before my PhD, I completed my BSc and MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/)
where I worked on detecting fake news and deepfakes.

  abstract = {The recent rise of fake news has heavily influenced people. From the 2016 US Presidential Elections to Pizzagate. Thus, it is essential to address this socially relevant phenomenon. Until now, most of the research done was related to satire and clickbait. This thesis explores the linguistic features that are able to distinguish between fake and real news headlines and statements. By extracting different linguistic features of statements and headlines, the predictive power of each different feature is explored. Using classifiers, the overall approach is discussed. It appears that unigrams, POS tag sequences, punctuation and generality are some of the features that have the most predictive power. In the end, the performances were above baseline.},

  abstract = {This report focuses on an interactive system that helps people during cooking by guiding them through the steps of a recipe which is obtained with the Spoonacular API. This involves both text and speech instructions that the system gives to the user, while the user can interact with it by using their voice and poses. In literature, these systems have been explored before, but only certain parts were implemented or it only gave limited feedback during cooking. This system guides a user completely through the process by reading out the equipment, ingredients and steps. Each multimedia component, speech and visuals, will be explored separately and then each component will be connected to the actual system by a user interface. This results in a system that works with textual input at the start, and voice commands and poses during the process where machine learning is used for the recognition of poses and the speech is made more efficient by using more words to recognize commands. Speech recognition is done with the Google Speech Recognition API and Kinect is used for the detection of the joint coordinates of poses. Training is done on a dataset which contains the arm coordinates and that can be extended. For classifying, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used since it gives the highest accuracy (99.76%) and is also relatively fast. The value for k is chosen to be 8, based on the amount of poses and a noise class. In the future, other multimedia components can be added to the infrastructure, since it is easily adjustable.},

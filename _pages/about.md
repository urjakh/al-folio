I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL)](https://home.cltl.labs.vu.nl/) 
at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl). 
I am advised by [Antske Fokkens](http://wordpress.let.vupr.nl/antske/) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) 
and [Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/) (Johns Hopkins University). 

I am passionate about understanding _what_ knowledge a language model has captured and whether it 
can **reliably** apply this knowledge across diverse (unseen) contexts; what will its **impact** 
be in the real world? I am particularly interested in analyzing and developing tools to ensure 
**responsible deployment**, with a big focus on **robustness** for _safety-critical applications_, e.g. hate speech detection. 

My work includes evaluating the generalization of model capabilities to unseen data, for 
instance [through the lens of model averaging and consistency](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eval4nlp-1.3). 
I have also proposed a method to [calibrate language models according to human subjectivity](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VWWzO3ewMS). 
Collaborating in an interdisciplinary environment with a social scientist and law expert, I 
characterized the [subjective aspects of hate speech and its impact on real-world deployment](https://aclanthology.org/2022.woah-1.17). 
Building on these insights, I developed a [framework to evaluate if a hate speech detection modelâ€™s 
behavior aligns with the type of hate speech it is intended to address](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15911). 

I earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam.
